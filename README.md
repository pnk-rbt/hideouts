# hideouts
Updated: 12/2/21

There's a multiplayer game world.

It's a top-down, 8-bitty world.

It's played in the browser.

There are spots throughout the world that can have little hideouts built into them. Think:
* houses in hills a la hobbiton
* treehouses
* houses built into mountainsides or caves
* under the sea (under the sea!)
* more

Hideouts are tradeable. 

Inside your hideouts, you can place furniture, decorations, TVs/games, etc. in your hideout, and can trade them with others. 

Tech stack:

  * phaser
  * solidity
  * react
  * next
